For details on the notation, you can also refer to the previous article. You may also encounter the intersection notation: $\\cap$. For instance $P(\\text{x} \\cap \\text{y})$ corresponds to the probability that both $\\text{x}$ and $\\text{y}$ occur.\n",

    "Let's try to understand what is really represented on these plots. I used the function `distplot` from the package seaborn. The y-axis gives the **probability density** that the variable takes the value given by the x-axis. You can find more details on probability density functions in [the last post](https://hadrienj.github.io/posts/Probability-Mass-and-Density-Functions/)/[notebook](https://github.com/hadrienj/deepLearningBook-Notes/tree/master/3.1-3.3%20Probability%20Mass%20and%20Density%20Functions). In short, the area under the curve has to be calculated for a certain range of the x axis to get the probability to get a value into that range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what about the marginal probabilities? If we want to get the marginal probability of $\\text{x}$, we need to get the **area under the curve** of the probability density function along the y-axis. You can imagine that we look the 3D plot only from the y-axis (or a projection on this axis) and get the area under the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete variables $\\text{x}$ and $\\text{y}$, we have seen that marginal probability $P(\\text{x})$ is the sum of the probabilities for each value of $\\text{y}$. Now that our variables are continuous, we have to use **integrals** but the principle is the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To calculate the marginal probability $P(\\text{x})$, we calculate the area under the curve of the projection of the variable on the x-axis.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is used to recover the probability distribution of one variable when we know the joint probability distribution. \n",

The variable following the small $d$ at the end of the equation tells the variable used for the integration. So in the first equation, we integrate over $\\text{y}$. This means that we consider $\\text{x}$ as a constant. We do the opposite in the second equation.\n"

    "# 3.5 Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability refers to the probability of an event given that another event occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependent and independent events\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is important to distinguish between dependent and independent events! The intuition is a bit different in both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of independent events: dice and coin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we do an experiment where we throw a dice and toss a coin. We'll call two random variables describing these events with $\\text{x}$ corresponding to the dice throw and $\\text{y}$ corresponding to the coin toss.\n",
    "\n",
    "A question we can ask is: what is the probability to get a 3 from the dice throw and a 'head' from the coin toss?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the two events are independent because we don't expect any effect of one on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of dependent events: two cards from a deck\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll get two cards in a deck without replacement. The probabilities are different when we take the first card (all 52 cards are in the deck) and when we take the second card (there is now 51 cards, one missing). This means that the events are dependent: the result from the first draw will impact the probabilities of the second draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "A question we can ask is: what is the probability to draw a 6 on the second draw when we got a 6 on the first draw?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",

    "<em>Conditional probability</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce some new notation: $P(\\text{y}=y | \\text{x}=x)$ describes the **conditional probability**: it is the probability that the random variable $\\text{y}$ takes the specific value $y$ **given that** the random variable $\\text{x}$ took the specific value $x$. It is different from $P(\\text{y}=y, \\text{x}=x)$ which corresponds to the probability of getting both the outcome $y$ for the random variable $\\text{y}$ and $x$ for the random variable $\\text{x}$. In the case of conditional probability, the event associated with the random variable $\\text{x}$ has already produced its outcome ($x$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, there is a convenient relationship between conditional probabilities and joint probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{y}=y | \\text{x}=x) = \\frac{P(\\text{y}=y, \\text{x}=x)}{P(\\text{x}=x)}\n",

    "To understand why probability multiplication has to be used we need to understand what is the probability of each event. Let's focus on the first event, the first coin tossing. The probability $\\frac{1}{2}$: the 1 corresponds to the number of \"success\" outcomes (i.e. get a 'head'). The denominator (2) corresponds to the total number of possibilities. The possible outcomes are 'heads' or 'tails', so there are two outcomes. This leads to our probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n",
